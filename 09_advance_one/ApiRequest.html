    *******************  CONSOLE LOG  *****************************
    - console log and document are not techniqully part of JS
    - console.log is a debugging tool. it is a developer tool of browser .
    -  Runtime of javascript enjects console.log


    - nodejs is an implementation of v8 engine
    - v8 engine is written in c++ and javascript actually runs through c++
    - v8 engine provides debugging tools, api access and console.log is also availabe here in v8 engine
    - javascript is wrapper of c++

<!-- 
    **************** Promise *********************
<> promise means that the given is not completed immediatly . it will complete in future

<> A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation

<> A Promise is in one of these states:
    - pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
    - fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
    - rejected: meaning that the operation failed.
 -->





 <!-- ***************** FETCH ******************* -->
 <!-- 
    -> The global fetch() method starts the process of fetching a resource from the network, returning a promise that is fulfilled once the response is available.
    -> A fetch() promise only rejects when a network error is encountered (which is usually when there's a permissions issue or similar). A fetch() promise does not reject on HTTP errors (404, etc.). Instead, a then() handler must check the Response.ok and/or Response.status properties.
